# Federated Learning with FedAvg on CIFAR-10

A complete implementation of Federated Averaging (FedAvg) algorithm for distributed machine learning on the CIFAR-10 dataset. This project includes a FastAPI-based web service, Docker containerization, and end-to-end pipeline for federated learning.

## Features

- **Federated Averaging Implementation**: Complete FedAvg algorithm implementation
- **CIFAR-10 Dataset**: Image classification using the popular CIFAR-10 dataset
- **FastAPI Web Service**: RESTful API endpoints for training and prediction
- **Docker Support**: Containerized application for easy deployment
- **Modular Architecture**: Clean separation of concerns with multiple Python modules
- **End-to-End Pipeline**: From data preprocessing to model deployment

## ⚙️ How to Run

You can run this project in **three different ways**:

---

### 1. Run via Jupyter Notebook (for experimentation)

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
jupyter notebook fedavg.ipynb
```
Walks through local training, aggregation, and evaluation in an interactive manner.

Ideal for learning and visualization.

### 2. Run via FastAPI with Uvicorn (for API serving)
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
uvicorn fedavg_api.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

Launches a REST API server for training and inference.

Swagger Docs: http://localhost:8000/docs

### 3. Run via Docker (for deployment)
```bash
# Build the image
docker build -t fedavg-api .

# Run the container
docker run -p 8000:8000 --name fedavg_container fedavg-api
```
API is served at http://localhost:8000/docs

No Python environment setup needed on host machine.

##If you don’t want to clone or set anything up manually, just use the prebuilt Docker image:
```bash
docker run -p 8000:8000 damanish/fedavg-api
```

### Training Endpoint
- **URL**: `POST /train`
- **Description**: Initiates federated learning training process

### Prediction Endpoint
- **URL**: `POST /predict`
- **Description**: Makes predictions using the trained federated model
- **Parameters**: 
  - `image`: Input image for classification

## 📊 Dataset

This project uses the **CIFAR-10** dataset, which consists of:
- 60,000 32x32 color images
- 10 classes: airplane, automobile, bird, cat, deer, dog, frog, horse, ship, truck
- 50,000 training images and 10,000 test images

## 🧠 Federated Learning Algorithm

The implementation uses **Federated Averaging (FedAvg)**, which:

1. **Initialization**: Server initializes a global model
2. **Client Selection**: Random subset of clients participate in each round
3. **Local Training**: Each client trains on local data
4. **Model Aggregation**: Server averages client model updates
5. **Global Update**: Updated global model is distributed to clients


## 📋 Requirements

```
fastapi
uvicorn[standard]
torch
torchvision
pillow
python-multipart
numpy
pydantic
```
Install all dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 📈 Performance

The federated learning setup achieves:
- **Convergence**: Typically converges within 5-10 rounds
- **Accuracy**: Achieves ~75% accuracy on Cifar10 test set then number of clients = 5 and alpha(for dirichlet partitioning = 0.5)
- **Privacy**: Data remains distributed across clients
